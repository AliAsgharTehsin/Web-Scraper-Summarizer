{"name": "Bitcoin", "paragraphs": ["", "Bitcoin  (abbreviation:  BTC ;  sign :  ₿ ) is the first  decentralized   cryptocurrency . Based on a  free-market  ideology, bitcoin was invented in 2008 when an unknown entity published a  white paper  under the pseudonym of  Satoshi Nakamoto . [ 4 ]  Use of bitcoin as a  currency  began in 2009, [ 5 ]  with the release of its  open-source implementation . [ 6 ] : ch. 1   From 2021 to 2025,  El Salvador adopted it as legal tender currency before revoking it . [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ]  As bitcoin is  pseudonymous ,  its use by criminals  has attracted the attention of regulators, leading to  its ban by several countries . [ 10 ]", "Bitcoin works through the collaboration of computers, each of which acts as a  node  in the  peer-to-peer   bitcoin network . Each node maintains an independent copy of a public  distributed ledger  of transactions, called a  blockchain , without central oversight. Transactions are validated through the use of  cryptography , preventing one person from spending another person's bitcoin, as long as the owner of the bitcoin keeps certain sensitive data secret. [ 6 ] : ch. 5", "Consensus  between nodes about the content of the blockchain is achieved using a  computationally intensive  process based on  proof of work , called  mining , which is performed by purpose-built computers. [ 6 ] : ch. 12   Mining consumes large quantities of electricity and has been criticized for  its environmental impact . [ 11 ]", "Before bitcoin, several  digital cash technologies  were released, starting with  David Chaum 's  ecash  in the 1980s. [ 12 ]  The idea that solutions to computational puzzles could have some value was first proposed by cryptographers  Cynthia Dwork  and  Moni Naor  in 1992. [ 13 ] [ 12 ]  The concept was  independently rediscovered  by  Adam Back  who developed  Hashcash , a  proof-of-work  scheme for  spam control  in 1997. [ 12 ]  The first proposals for distributed digital scarcity-based  cryptocurrencies  came from  cypherpunks   Wei Dai  (b-money) and  Nick Szabo  ( bit gold ) in 1998. [ 14 ]  In 2004,  Hal Finney  developed the first currency based on reusable proof of work. [ 15 ]  These various attempts were not successful: [ 12 ]  Chaum's concept required centralized control and no banks wanted to sign on, Hashcash had no protection against  double-spending , while b-money and bit gold were not resistant to  Sybil attacks . [ 12 ]", "The domain name  bitcoin.org  was registered on 18 August 2008. [ 16 ]  On 31 October 2008, a link to a  white paper  authored by  Satoshi Nakamoto  titled  Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System  was posted to a cryptography mailing list. [ 17 ]  Nakamoto's identity remains unknown. [ 4 ]  According to computer scientist  Arvind Narayanan , all individual components of bitcoin originated in earlier academic literature. [ 12 ]  Nakamoto's innovation was their complex interplay resulting in the first decentralized,  Sybil resistant ,  Byzantine fault  tolerant digital cash system, that would eventually be referred to as the first blockchain. [ 12 ] [ 18 ]  Nakamoto's paper was not  peer reviewed  and was initially ignored by academics, who argued that it could not work. [ 12 ]", "Nakamoto released bitcoin as  open-source software . [ 19 ]  On 3 January 2009, the bitcoin network was created when Nakamoto mined the starting block of the chain, known as the  genesis block . [ 20 ]  Embedded in this block was the text \"The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of  second bailout for banks \", which is the date and headline of an issue of  The Times  newspaper. [ 5 ]  Nine days later, Hal Finney received the first bitcoin transaction: ten bitcoins from Nakamoto. [ 21 ]  Wei Dai and Nick Szabo were also early supporters. [ 20 ]  On May 22, 2010, the first known  commercial transaction  using bitcoin occurred when programmer Laszlo Hanyecz bought two  Papa John's  pizzas for ₿10,000, in what would later be celebrated as \"Bitcoin Pizza Day\". [ 22 ]  Satoshi tasked Finnish developer and early Bitcoin contributor  Martti Malmi  [ fi ]  with creating content for the bitcoin.org website. [ 23 ] [ 24 ]", "Blockchain analysts  estimate that Nakamoto had mined about one million bitcoins [ 25 ]  before disappearing in 2010 when he handed the network alert key and control of the  code repository  over to  Gavin Andresen . Andresen later became lead developer at the  Bitcoin Foundation , [ 26 ] [ 27 ]  an  organization  founded in September 2012 to promote bitcoin. [ 28 ]", "After early \" proof-of-concept \" transactions, the first major users of bitcoin were  black markets , such as the  dark web   Silk Road . During its 30 months of existence, beginning in February 2011, Silk Road exclusively accepted bitcoins as payment, transacting ₿9.9 million, worth about $214 million. [ 29 ] : 222", "In March 2013, the US  Financial Crimes Enforcement Network  (FinCEN) established regulatory guidelines for \"decentralized virtual currencies\" such as bitcoin, classifying American bitcoin miners who sell their generated bitcoins as  money services businesses , subject to registration and other legal obligations. [ 30 ]  In May 2013, US authorities seized the unregistered  exchange   Mt. Gox . [ 31 ]  In June 2013, the US  Drug Enforcement Administration  seized ₿11.02 from an individual attempting to use them to purchase illicit drugs. This marked the first time a government agency had seized bitcoins. [ 32 ]  The FBI seized about ₿30,000 in October 2013 from Silk Road, following the arrest of its founder  Ross Ulbricht . [ 33 ]", "In December 2013, the  People's Bank of China  prohibited Chinese financial institutions from using bitcoin. [ 34 ]  After the announcement, the value of bitcoin dropped, [ 35 ]  and  Baidu  no longer accepted bitcoins for certain services. [ 36 ]  Buying real-world goods with any virtual currency had been illegal in China since at least 2009. [ 37 ]", "Research produced by the  University of Cambridge  estimated that in 2017, there were 2.9 to 5.8 million unique users using a  cryptocurrency wallet , most of them using bitcoin. [ 38 ]  In August 2017, the  SegWit  software upgrade was activated. Segwit was intended to support the  Lightning Network  as well as improve  scalability . [ 39 ]  SegWit opponents, who supported larger blocks as a scalability solution,  forked  to create  Bitcoin Cash , one of many  forks of bitcoin . [ 40 ]", "In December 2017, the first  futures  on bitcoin was introduced by the  Chicago Mercantile Exchange  (CME). [ 41 ]", "In February 2018, the price crashed after China imposed a complete ban on bitcoin trading. [ 42 ]  The percentage of bitcoin trading in the Chinese  renminbi  fell from over 90% in September 2017 to less than 1% in June 2018. [ 43 ]  During the same year, bitcoin prices were negatively affected by several hacks or thefts from cryptocurrency exchanges. [ 44 ]", "In 2020, some major companies and institutions started to acquire bitcoin:  MicroStrategy  invested $250 million in bitcoin as a  treasury reserve asset , [ 46 ]   Square, Inc. , $50 million, [ 47 ]  and  MassMutual , $100 million. [ 48 ]  In November 2020,  PayPal  added support for bitcoin in the US. [ 49 ]", "In February 2021, bitcoin's  market capitalization  reached $1 trillion for the first time. [ 50 ]  In November 2021, the  Taproot   soft-fork  upgrade was activated, adding support for  Schnorr signatures , improved functionality of  smart contracts  and  Lightning Network . [ 51 ]  Before, bitcoin only used a custom  elliptic curve  with the  ECDSA  algorithm to produce  signatures . [ 52 ] : 101   In September 2021, bitcoin became  legal tender  currency  in El Salvador , alongside the US dollar. [ 7 ]  In October 2021, the first bitcoin futures  exchange-traded fund  (ETF), called BITO, from  ProShares  was approved by the  SEC  and listed on the  CME . [ 53 ]", "In early 2022, during the  Canadian trucker protests  opposing  COVID-19 vaccine mandates , organizers turned to bitcoin to receive donations after traditional financial platforms restricted access to funding. [ 54 ] [ 55 ]  Proponents highlighted bitcoin's use as a tool for fundraising in situations where access to conventional financial systems may be restricted. [ 56 ] [ 57 ]  In May and June 2022, the bitcoin price fell following the collapses of  TerraUSD , a  stablecoin , [ 58 ]  and the  Celsius Network , a cryptocurrency loan company. [ 59 ] [ 60 ]", "In 2023, ordinals— non-fungible tokens  (NFTs)—on bitcoin, went live. [ 61 ]  As of June 2023, River Financial estimated that bitcoin had 81.7 million users, about 1% of the global population. [ 62 ]", "In January 2024, the first 11 US  spot  bitcoin  ETFs  began trading, offering direct exposure to bitcoin for the first time on American stock exchanges. [ 63 ] [ 64 ]  In December 2024, bitcoin price reached $100,000 for the first time, as US president-elect  Donald Trump  promised to make the US the \"crypto capital of the planet\" and to stockpile bitcoin. [ 65 ]  The same month,  BlackRock , the world's largest  asset manager , recommended investors to allocate up to 2% of their  portfolio  to bitcoin. [ 66 ]", "As of 2025, the Salvadoran government continues to describe Bitcoin as legal tender under the 2021 Bitcoin Law; however, a January 2025 reform removed obligations for businesses and the government to accept it, so many analysts regard its legal-tender status as effectively ended in practice. [ 8 ] [ 9 ]  In March 2025,  President Trump  signed an  executive order  to establish a  strategic bitcoin reserve . [ 67 ]  Later that year, some U.S. states, such as  Texas  and  New Hampshire  also instituted strategic bitcoin reserves, [ 68 ]  and the  Czech National Bank  bought less than €1 million in a \"test portfolio\". [ 69 ]", "The  unit of account  of the bitcoin system is the  bitcoin . It is most commonly represented with the  symbol  ₿ [ 1 ]  and the  currency code  BTC. However, the BTC code does not conform to  ISO 4217  as BT is the country code of Bhutan, [ 70 ]  and ISO 4217 requires the first letter used in global commodities to be 'X'. [ 70 ]  XBT, a code that conforms to  ISO 4217  though not officially part of it, [ 70 ]  is used by  Bloomberg L.P. [ 71 ]", "No uniform  capitalization  convention exists; some sources use  Bitcoin , capitalized, to refer to the technology and  network , and  bitcoin , lowercase, for the unit of account. [ 72 ]  The  Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary  and the  Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary  use the capitalized and lowercase variants without distinction. [ 73 ] [ 74 ]", "One bitcoin is divisible to eight decimal places. [ 6 ] : ch. 5   Units for smaller amounts of bitcoin are the millibitcoin (mBTC), equal to  1 ⁄ 1000  bitcoin, and the satoshi [ a ]  (sat), representing  1 ⁄ 100 000 000  (one hundred millionth) bitcoin, the smallest amount possible. [ 2 ]  100,000 satoshis are one mBTC. [ 75 ]", "As a  decentralized  system, bitcoin operates without a central authority or single administrator, [ 76 ]  so that anyone can create a new bitcoin address and transact without needing any approval. [ 6 ] : ch. 1   This is accomplished through a specialized  distributed ledger  called a  blockchain  that records bitcoin transactions. [ 77 ]", "The blockchain is implemented as an ordered list of  blocks . Each block contains a  SHA-256   hash  of the previous block, [ 77 ]  chaining them in chronological order. [ 6 ] : ch. 7  [ 77 ]  The blockchain is maintained by a  peer-to-peer  network. [ 29 ] : 215–219   Individual blocks, public addresses, and transactions within blocks are public information, and can be examined using a blockchain explorer. [ 78 ]", "Nodes validate and broadcast transactions, each maintaining a copy of the blockchain for ownership verification. [ 79 ]  A new block is created every 10 minutes on average, updating the blockchain across all nodes without central oversight. This process tracks bitcoin spending, ensuring each bitcoin is  spent only once . Unlike a traditional ledger that tracks physical currency, bitcoins exist digitally as  unspent outputs of transactions . [ 6 ] : ch. 5", "In the blockchain, bitcoins are linked to specific  strings  called addresses. Most often, an address encodes a  hash  of a single  public key . Creating such an address involves generating a random private key and then computing the corresponding address. This process is almost instant, but the reverse (finding the private key for a given address) is nearly impossible. [ 6 ] : ch. 4   Publishing such a bitcoin address does not risk its private key, and it is extremely unlikely to accidentally generate a used key with funds. To use bitcoins, owners need their private key to  digitally sign  transactions, which are verified by the network using the public key, keeping the private key secret. [ 6 ] : ch. 5   An address may encode the hash of a bitcoin script that specifies more complex requirements to spend the funds. One common example is \"multisig\", in which multiple distinct private keys must mutually sign any transaction that attempts to spend the funds. [ 6 ] : ch. 7", "Bitcoin transactions use a  Forth -like  scripting language , [ 6 ] : ch. 5   involving one or more inputs and outputs. When sending bitcoins, a user specifies the recipients' addresses and the amount for each output. This allows sending bitcoins to several recipients in a single transaction. To prevent double-spending, each input must refer to a previous unspent output in the blockchain. [ 80 ]  Using multiple inputs is similar to using multiple coins in a cash transaction. As in a cash transaction, the sum of inputs can exceed the intended sum of payments. In such a case, an additional output can return the change back to the payer. [ 80 ]  Unallocated input satoshis in the transaction become the transaction fee. [ 80 ]", "Losing a private key means losing access to the bitcoins, with no other proof of ownership accepted by the  protocol . [ 29 ]  For instance, in 2013, a user lost ₿7,500, valued at US$7.5 million, by accidentally discarding a  hard drive  with the private key. [ 81 ]  It is estimated that around 20% of all bitcoins are lost. [ 82 ]  The private key must also be kept secret as its exposure, such as through a  data breach , can lead to theft of the associated bitcoins. [ 6 ] : ch. 10  [ 83 ]  As of December 2017 [update] , approximately ₿980,000 had been stolen from  cryptocurrency exchanges . [ 84 ]", "Miners don't directly act as nodes, but do communicate with nodes. The mining process is primarily intended to prevent  double-spending  and get all nodes to agree on the content of the blockchain, but it also has desirable side-effects such as making it infeasible for adversaries to stifle valid transactions or alter the historical record of transactions, since doing so generally requires the adversary to have access to more mining power than the rest of the network combined. [ 6 ] : ch. 12", "The mining process in bitcoin involves maintaining the blockchain through computer  processing power . Miners group and broadcast new transactions into blocks, which are then verified by the network. [ 77 ]  Each block must contain a proof of work (PoW) to be accepted, [ 77 ]  involving finding a  nonce  number that, combined with the block content, produces a  hash  numerically smaller than the network's  difficulty target . [ 6 ] : ch. 8   This PoW is simple to verify but hard to generate, requiring many attempts. [ 6 ] : ch. 8   PoW forms the basis of bitcoin's  consensus mechanism . [ 85 ]", "The difficulty of generating a block is  deterministically adjusted  based on the  mining power on the network  by changing the difficulty target, which is recalibrated every 2,016 blocks (approximately two weeks) to maintain an average time of ten minutes between new blocks. The process requires significant computational power and specialized  hardware . [ 6 ] : ch. 8  [ 86 ]", "Miners who successfully create a new block with a valid nonce can collect transaction fees from the included transactions and a fixed reward in bitcoins. [ 87 ]  To claim this reward, a special transaction called a  coinbase  is included in the block, with the miner as the payee. All bitcoins in existence have been created through this type of transaction. [ 6 ] : ch. 8   This reward is halved every 210,000 blocks until ₿21 million [ b ]  have been issued in total, which is expected to occur around the year 2140. Afterward, miners will only earn from transaction fees. These fees are determined by the transaction's size and the amount of data stored, measured in satoshis per byte. [ 88 ] [ 80 ] [ 6 ] : ch. 8", "The proof of work system and the chaining of blocks make blockchain modifications very difficult, as altering one block requires changing all subsequent blocks. As more blocks are added, modifying older blocks becomes increasingly challenging. [ 89 ] [ 77 ]  In case of disagreement, nodes trust the longest chain, which required the greatest amount of effort to produce. [ 85 ]  To tamper or censor the ledger, one needs to control the majority of the global  hashrate . [ 85 ]  The high cost required to reach this level of computational power  secures  the bitcoin blockchain. [ 85 ]", "The  environmental impact of bitcoin mining  is controversial and has attracted the attention of regulators,  leading to restrictions or incentives in various jurisdictions . [ 90 ]  As of 2025 [update] , a  non-peer-reviewed  study by the  Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance  (CCAF) estimated that bitcoin mining represented 0.5% of  global electricity consumption  and 0.08% of world  greenhouse gas emissions , comparable to Slovakia's emissions. [ 91 ]  About half of the electricity used is generated through  fossil fuels . [ 92 ]  Moreover, mining hardware's short lifespan results in  electronic waste . [ 93 ]", "Bitcoin is  pseudonymous , with funds linked to addresses, not real-world identities. While the owners of these addresses are not directly identified, all transactions are public on the blockchain. Patterns of use, like spending coins from multiple inputs, can hint at a common owner. Public data can sometimes be matched with known address owners. [ 94 ]   Bitcoin exchanges  might also need to collect personal data as per legal requirements. [ 95 ]  For enhanced  privacy , users can generate a new address for each transaction. [ 96 ]", "In the bitcoin network, each bitcoin is treated equally, ensuring basic  fungibility . However, users and applications can choose to differentiate between bitcoins. While wallets and software treat all bitcoins the same, each bitcoin's transaction history is recorded on the blockchain. This public record allows for  chain analysis , where users can identify and potentially reject bitcoins from controversial sources. [ 97 ]  For example, in 2012, Mt. Gox froze accounts containing bitcoins identified as stolen. [ 98 ]", "Bitcoin wallets were the first  cryptocurrency wallets , enabling users to store the information necessary to transact bitcoins. [ 99 ] [ 6 ] : ch. 1, glossary   The first wallet program, simply named  Bitcoin , and sometimes referred to as the  Satoshi client , was released in 2009 by Nakamoto as  open-source software . [ 19 ]   Bitcoin Core  is among the best known  clients .  Forks  of Bitcoin Core exist such as  Bitcoin Unlimited . [ 100 ]  Wallets can be full clients, with a full copy of the blockchain to check the validity of mined blocks, [ 6 ] : ch. 1   or lightweight clients, just to send and receive transactions without a local copy of the entire blockchain. [ 101 ]  Third-party internet services, called online wallets or  hot wallets , store users' credentials on their servers, making them susceptible of hacks. [ 102 ]   Cold storage  protects bitcoins from such hacks by keeping private keys offline, either through specialized hardware wallets or paper printouts. [ 103 ] [ 6 ] : ch. 4", "Nakamoto limited the block size to one  megabyte . [ 104 ]  The limited block size and frequency can lead to delayed processing of transactions, increased fees and a bitcoin scalability problem. [ 105 ]  The  Lightning Network ,  second-layer   routing  network, is a potential scaling solution. [ 6 ] : ch. 8", "Research shows a trend towards centralization in bitcoin as miners join  pools  for stable income. [ 29 ] : 215, 219–222  [ 106 ] : 3   If a single miner or pool controls more than 50% of the  hashing power , it would allow them to censor transactions and double-spend coins. [ 76 ]  In 2014, mining pool  Ghash.io  reached 51% mining power, causing safety concerns, but later voluntarily capped its power at 39.99% for the benefit of the whole network. [ 107 ]  A few entities also dominate other parts of the ecosystem such as the client software, online wallets, and simplified payment verification (SPV) clients. [ 76 ]", "According to the  European Central Bank , the decentralization of money offered by bitcoin has its theoretical roots in the  Austrian school of economics , especially with  Friedrich Hayek 's  The Denationalisation of Money , in which he advocates a complete  free market  in the production, distribution and management of money to end the monopoly of  central banks . [ 108 ] : 22   Sociologist  Nigel Dodd  argues that the essence of the bitcoin ideology is to remove money from social, as well as governmental, control. [ 109 ]   The Economist  describes bitcoin as \"a  techno-anarchist  project to create an online version of cash, a way for people to transact without the possibility of interference from malicious governments or banks\". [ 110 ]  These philosophical ideas initially attracted  libertarians  and  anarchists . [ 111 ]", "Money  serves three purposes: a  store of value , a  medium of exchange , and a  unit of account . [ 112 ]  According to  The Economist  in 2014, bitcoin functions best as a medium of exchange. [ 112 ]  In 2015,  The Economist  noted that bitcoins had three qualities useful in a currency: they are \"hard to earn, limited in supply and easy to verify\". [ 113 ]  However, a 2018 assessment by  The Economist  stated that cryptocurrencies met none of these three criteria. [ 110 ]  Per some researchers, as of 2015 [update] , bitcoin functions more as a  payment system  than as a currency. [ 29 ]  In 2014, economist  Robert J. Shiller  wrote that bitcoin has potential as a unit of account for measuring the relative value of goods, as with Chile's  Unidad de Fomento , but that \"Bitcoin in its present form... doesn't really solve any sensible economic problem\". [ 114 ]  In 2017, François Velde, senior economist at the  Chicago Fed , described bitcoin as \"unlikely by itself to replace monies in well-functioning monetary systems.\" [ 115 ]", "The  legal status of bitcoin  varies substantially from one jurisdiction to another. Because of its decentralized nature and its global presence, regulating bitcoin is difficult. However, the use of bitcoin can be criminalized, and shutting down exchanges and the peer-to-peer economy in a given country would constitute a  de facto  ban. [ 116 ]  The  use of bitcoin by criminals  has attracted the attention of financial regulators, legislative bodies, and law enforcement. [ 117 ]  Nobel-prize winning economist  Joseph Stiglitz  says that bitcoin's anonymity encourages  money laundering  and other crimes. [ 118 ]  This is the main justification behind bitcoin bans. [ 10 ]  As of November 2021 [update] , nine countries applied an absolute ban (Algeria, Bangladesh, China, Egypt, Iraq, Morocco, Nepal, Qatar, and Tunisia) while another 42 countries had an implicit ban. [ 119 ] [ needs update ]", "According to Harvard Professor  Kenneth Rogoff  as of 2025 [update] , bitcoin is rarely used in regular transactions with merchants, but is popular in the  informal economy  and for criminal activities. [ 120 ] [ 121 ]  Prices are not usually quoted in bitcoin and trades involve conversions into  fiat  currencies. [ 29 ]  Commonly cited reasons for not using bitcoin include high costs, the inability to process  chargebacks , high  price volatility , long transaction times, and  transaction fees  (especially for small purchases). [ 122 ] [ 123 ]   Bloomberg  reported that bitcoin was being used for large-item purchases on the site  Overstock.com  and for cross-border payments to  freelancers . [ 124 ]  As of 2015 [update] , there was little sign of bitcoin use in international  remittances  despite high fees charged by banks and  Western Union . [ 29 ] [ 125 ]", "From September 2021 until January 2025, the  Bitcoin Law  made bitcoin a  legal tender  currency in  El Salvador , alongside the US dollar. [ 7 ]  The adoption had been criticized internationally and within El Salvador. [ 7 ] [ 126 ]  In 2022, the  International Monetary Fund  (IMF) urged El Salvador to reverse its decision. [ 127 ]  As of 2022 [update] , the use of  Bitcoin in El Salvador  remained low: 80% of businesses refused to accept it. [ 128 ]  In 2025, El Salvador's government revoked bitcoin's status as legal tender currency in order to comply with conditions set by the IMF for a loan. El Salvador still describes bitcoin as \"legal tender\", but its acceptance is no longer obligitory (as it is with the US dollar) and the El Salvador government no longer accepts bitcoin for payment of taxes or fees. [ 8 ] [ 9 ]", "In April 2022, the  Central African Republic  (CAR) adopted bitcoin as legal tender alongside the  CFA franc , [ 129 ]  but repealed the reform one year later. [ 130 ]", "Bitcoin is also used by some governments. For instance, the  Iranian government  initially opposed cryptocurrencies, but later began using them to circumvent  sanctions . [ 131 ]  Since 2020, Iran has required local bitcoin miners to sell bitcoin to the  Central Bank of Iran , allowing the central bank to use it for imports. [ 132 ]  Some  constituent states  and  local governments  also accept tax payments in bitcoin, including  Colorado  in the US [ 133 ]  and  Zug  and  Lugano  in Switzerland. [ 134 ] [ 135 ]  As of 2023, the US government owned more than $5 billion worth of seized bitcoin. [ 136 ] [ 137 ]", "As of 2018 [update] , the overwhelming majority of bitcoin transactions took place on  cryptocurrency exchanges . [ 122 ]  Since 2014, regulated bitcoin funds also allow  exposure  to the asset or to  futures  as an investment. [ 138 ] [ 139 ]  Bitcoin is used as a  store of value : [ 140 ] [ 141 ]  individuals and companies such as the  Winklevoss twins [ 142 ]  and  Elon Musk 's companies  SpaceX  and  Tesla  have each bought and sold hundreds of millions of dollars worth of bitcoin. [ 143 ] [ 144 ] [ 145 ]  Bitcoin wealth is highly concentrated, with 0.01% holding 27% of in-circulation currency, as of 2021. [ 146 ]", "As of September 2023 [update] , El Salvador had $76.5 million worth of bitcoin in its  international reserves . [ 147 ]", "In 2018, research published in the  Journal of Monetary Economics  concluded that  price manipulation  occurred during the  Mt. Gox  bitcoin theft and that the market remained vulnerable to manipulation. [ 148 ]  Research published in  The Journal of Finance  also suggested that trading associated with increases in the amount of the  Tether cryptocurrency  and associated trading at the  Bitfinex  exchange accounted for about half of the price increase in bitcoin in late 2017. [ 149 ] [ 150 ]", "Bitcoin, along with other cryptocurrencies, has been described as an  economic bubble  by several economists, including  Nobel Prize in Economics  laureates, such as  Joseph Stiglitz , [ 151 ]   James Heckman , [ 152 ]  and  Paul Krugman . [ 153 ]  Another recipient of the prize,  Robert Shiller , argues that bitcoin is rather a  fad  that may become an  asset class . He describes its price growth as an \"epidemic\", driven by  contagious narratives . [ 154 ]  In 2024,  Jean Tirole , also Nobel laureate, described bitcoin as a \"pure bubble\" as its  intrinsic value  is zero. According to him, some bubbles are long-lasting such as gold and fiat currencies, and that it was impossible to predict whether it would implode like other financial bubbles or become an alternative to gold. [ 155 ]  The same year,  Federal Reserve Chair   Jerome Powell  described bitcoin as a digital competitor to gold but not to the dollar as he argued it is a highly volatile  speculative  asset not used as a form of payment. [ 156 ]  In 2025,  Kenneth Rogoff  claimed that Krugman was wrong and that Bitcoin had value as it is competing with the dollar to become the  means of exchange  of the  underground economy  which represents 20% of the world's  GDP . [ 120 ] [ 121 ]", "According to research published in the  International Review of Financial Analysis  in 2018, bitcoin as an asset is highly volatile and does not behave like any other conventional asset. [ 157 ]  According to one 2022 analysis published in  The Journal of Alternative Investments , bitcoin was less volatile than  oil ,  silver ,  US Treasuries , and 190 stocks in the  S&P 500  during and after the  2020 stock market crash . [ 158 ]  The term  hodl  was created in December 2013 for  holding  bitcoin rather than selling it during periods of volatility. [ 159 ] [ 160 ]", "In 2014, economist  Nouriel Roubini  described bitcoin as a  Ponzi scheme . [ 161 ]  Legal scholar  Eric Posner  disagrees, however, as \"a real Ponzi scheme takes fraud; bitcoin, by contrast, seems more like a collective  delusion \". [ 162 ]  A 2014  World Bank  report also concluded that bitcoin was not a deliberate Ponzi scheme. [ 163 ]", "Bitcoin markets operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week, contrasting with traditional financial markets that have fixed trading hours.

[ 5 ]  In 2014,  development  work began and was  crowdfunded , and the network went live on 30 July 2015. [ 6 ]  Ethereum allows anyone to deploy  decentralized applications  onto it, which anyone can then use. [ 7 ]   Decentralized finance  (DeFi) applications provide  financial instruments  that do not directly rely on  financial intermediaries  like  brokerages ,  exchanges , or  banks . This facilitates borrowing against cryptocurrency holdings or lending them out for  interest . [ 8 ] [ 9 ]  Ethereum allows users to create fungible (e.g. ERC-20) and  non-fungible tokens  (NFTs) with a variety of properties, and to create smart contracts that can receive, hold and send those assets in accordance with the contract's immutable code and a transaction's input data.", "On 15 September 2022, Ethereum transitioned its  consensus mechanism  from  proof-of-work  (PoW) to  proof-of-stake  (PoS) in an update known as \"The Merge\", which cut the blockchain's energy usage by over 99%. [ 10 ] [ 11 ]", "Ethereum was initially described in late 2013 in a  white paper  by  Vitalik Buterin , [ 4 ] [ 12 ]  a programmer and co-founder of  Bitcoin Magazine , that described a way to build  decentralized  applications. [ 13 ] [ 14 ]  Buterin argued to the  Bitcoin Core  developers that blockchain technology could benefit from other applications besides money and that it needed a more robust language for application development [ 15 ] : 88   that could lead to  attaching [ clarification needed ]   real-world assets , such as stocks and property, to the blockchain. [ 16 ]  In 2013, Buterin briefly worked with  eToro  CEO Yoni Assia on the  Colored Coins  project and drafted its white paper outlining additional use cases for blockchain technology. [ 17 ]  However, after failing to gain agreement on how the project should proceed, he proposed the development of a new platform with a more robust scripting language—a  Turing-complete  programming language [ 18 ] —that would eventually become Ethereum. [ 15 ]", "Ethereum was announced at the North American Bitcoin Conference in Miami, in January 2014. [ 19 ]  During the conference,  Gavin Wood ,  Charles Hoskinson , and  Anthony Di Iorio  (who financed the project) rented a house in Miami with Buterin at which they could develop a fuller sense of what Ethereum might become. [ 19 ]  Di Iorio invited friend  Joseph Lubin , who invited reporter Morgen Peck, to bear witness. [ 19 ]  Peck subsequently wrote about the experience in  Wired . [ 20 ]  Six months later the founders met again in  Zug , Switzerland, where Buterin told the founders that the project would proceed as a non-profit. Hoskinson left the project at that time and soon after founded IOHK, a blockchain company responsible for  Cardano . [ 19 ]", "Ethereum has an unusually long list of founders. [ 21 ]  Anthony Di Iorio wrote: \"Ethereum was founded by Vitalik Buterin, Myself, Charles Hoskinson, Mihai Alisie & Amir Chetrit (the initial 5) in December 2013. Joseph Lubin, Gavin Wood, & Jeffrey Wilcke were added in early 2014 as founders.\" Buterin chose the name Ethereum after browsing  a list of elements from science fiction  on  Wikipedia . He stated, \"I immediately realized that I liked it better than all of the other alternatives that I had seen; I suppose it was that [it] sounded nice and it had the word ' ether ', referring to the hypothetical invisible medium that permeates the universe and allows light to travel.\" [ 19 ]  Buterin wanted his platform to be the underlying and imperceptible medium for the applications running on top of it. [ 22 ]", "Formal development of the software underlying Ethereum began in early 2014 through a Swiss company, Ethereum Switzerland GmbH ( EthSuisse ). [ 23 ] The idea of putting executable  smart contracts  in the blockchain needed to be specified before it could be implemented in software. This work was done by Gavin Wood, then the  chief technology officer , in the Ethereum Yellow Paper that specified the Ethereum Virtual Machine. [ 24 ] [ 25 ]  Subsequently, a Swiss non-profit foundation, the  Ethereum Foundation  ( Stiftung Ethereum ), was founded. Development was funded by an online public crowd sale from July to August 2014, in which participants bought the Ethereum value token (ether) with another digital currency,  bitcoin . While there was early praise for the technical innovations of Ethereum, questions were also raised about its security and scalability. [ 13 ]", "The Foundation funded multiple teams in different cities building three separate implementations of the protocol: Geth ( Go ), Pyethereum ( Python ), a  C++  implementation, and also Swarm ( decentralized file storage ), Mist Browser (A wallet,  browser  and a user interface for smart contracts, now defunct) among other projects. The intended purpose of the three distinct implementations would be so that if one of them had a bug, the other two could be used as a comparison.", "Several codenamed prototypes of Ethereum were developed over 18 months in 2014 and 2015 by the Ethereum Foundation as part of their  proof-of-concept  series. [ 4 ]  \"Olympic\" was the last prototype and public beta pre-release. The Olympic network gave users a  bug bounty  of 25,000 ether for stress-testing the Ethereum blockchain. On 30 July 2015, \"Frontier\" marked the official launch of the Ethereum platform, and Ethereum created its \"genesis block\".

[ 29 ]   Emin Gün Sirer , Vlad Zamfir and Dino Mark had written a paper called  A Call for a Temporary Moratorium on The DAO  in which they described in which way the DAO might be vunerable to attacks. [ 30 ]  The DAO was exploited in June 2016 when  US$50 million  of DAO tokens were stolen by an unknown hacker. [ 31 ] [ 32 ]  The event sparked a debate in the crypto-community about whether Ethereum should perform a contentious \"hard fork\" to reappropriate the affected funds. [ 33 ]  The fork resulted in the network splitting into two blockchains: Ethereum with the theft reversed, and  Ethereum Classic  which continued on the original chain.

It brought various updates, including EIP-7251, which increases the staking amount per validator from exactly 32 ETH to anywhere between 32 ETH to 2048 ETH, and EIP-7702, which allows for the EOA addresses to use functionality from a smart contract. [ 59 ]", "Ethereum is a  peer-to-peer network  that maintains a  database  containing the storage values of all Ethereum accounts and processes state-altering transactions. [ 60 ]  Approximately every 12 seconds, a batch of new transactions, known as a \"block\", is processed by the network. Each block contains a  cryptographic hash  identifying the series of blocks that must precede it if the block is to be considered valid. This series of blocks is known as the  blockchain . [ 61 ]", "Each \"node\" (network participant) connects with a relatively small subset of the network to offer blocks and unvalidated transactions (i.e. transactions not yet in the blockchain) to its peers for download, and it downloads any from its peers that it doesn't already have. Each node usually has a unique set of peers, so that offering an item to its peers results in the propagation of that item throughout the entire network within seconds. A node's collection of unvalidated transactions is known as its \"mempool\". [ 62 ]", "A node may choose to create a copy of the state for itself. It does this by starting with the genesis state and executing every transaction in the blockchain, in the proper order of blocks and in the order they are listed within each block. [ 63 ]", "Any Ethereum account may \"stake\" (deposit) 32 or more ETH to register a \"validator\". At the end of each \"epoch\" (32 block slots, each slot lasting 12 seconds), each validator is  pseudorandomly  assigned to one of the slots of the epoch after the next, either as the block proposer or as an attester. During a slot, the block proposer uses their mempool to create a block that is intended to become the new \"head\" (latest block) of the blockchain, and the attesters attest to which block is at the head of the chain. If a validator makes self-contradicting proposals or attestations, or if it is inactive, it loses a portion of its stake. Any Ethereum account may send ETH to a validator at any time to increase its stake. A validator's attestation is given a weight equal to its stake or 2,048, whichever is less. According to the Ethereum protocol, the blockchain with the highest accumulated weight of attestations at any given time is to be regarded as the canonical chain. Validators are rewarded for making valid proposals and attestations. A validator's rewards are paid via transactions within the same chain that contains their proposal or attestation, and therefore would have little or no market value unless that chain becomes the canonical chain. This incentivizes validators to support the chain that they think other validators view as the canonical chain, which results in a high degree of consensus. [ 64 ]", "Ether (ETH) is the cryptocurrency generated in accordance with the Ethereum protocol as a reward to validators in a  proof-of-stake  system for adding blocks to the blockchain. Ether is represented in the state as an  unsigned   integer  associated with each account, this being the account's ETH balance denominated in wei (10 18  wei = 1 ether). At the end of each epoch, new ETH is generated by the addition of protocol-specified amounts to the balances of all validators that made valid block proposals or attestations in the epoch before the last (i.e. the epoch being finalized). Additionally, ether is the only currency accepted by the protocol as payment for the transaction fee. The transaction fee is composed of two parts: the base fee and the tip. The base fee is \"burned\" (deleted from existence) and the tip goes to the block proposer. The validator reward together with the tips provide the incentive to validators to keep the blockchain growing (i.e. to keep processing new transactions). Therefore, ETH is fundamental to the operation of the network. Ether may be \"sent\" from one account to another via a transaction, the execution of which simply entails subtracting the  amount to be sent  from the sender's balance and adding the same amount to the recipient's balance. [ 65 ]", "Ether is often erroneously referred to as \"Ethereum\". [ 66 ]", "The uppercase Greek letter  Xi , Ξ, is sometimes used as a  currency symbol  for ether. [ citation needed ]", "There are two types of accounts on Ethereum: user accounts (also known as externally-owned accounts), and contract accounts. Both types have an ETH balance, may transfer ETH to any account, may execute the code of another contract, or create a new contract, and are identified on the blockchain and in the state by an account address. [ 67 ]", "Contracts are the only type of account that has associated  bytecode  and storage (to store contract-specific state). The code of a contract is evaluated when a transaction is sent to it. The code of the contract may read user-specified data from the transaction, and may have a  return value . In addition to  control flow  statements, the bytecode may include instructions to send ETH, read from and write to the contract's storage, create temporary storage ( memory ) that vanishes at the end of code evaluation, perform  arithmetic  and hashing operations, send transaction-like calls to other contracts (thus executing their code), create new contracts, and query information about the current transaction or the blockchain. [ 68 ] [ unreliable source? ]", "Ethereum account addresses are composed of the prefix \" 0x \" (a common identifier for  hexadecimal ) concatenated with the rightmost 20 bytes of the  Keccak-256  hash of the  ECDSA   public key  (the curve used is the so-called  secp256k1 ). In hexadecimal, two digits represent a byte, and so addresses contain 40 hexadecimal digits after the \" 0x \", e.g.  0xb794f5ea0ba39494ce839613fffba74279579268 . Contract addresses are in the same format, however, they are determined by sender and creation transaction  nonce . [ 69 ]", "The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is the  runtime  environment for transaction execution in Ethereum. The EVM is a  stack  based virtual machine with an  instruction set  specifically designed for Ethereum. The instruction set includes, among other things, stack operations, memory operations, and operations to inspect the current execution context, such as remaining gas, information about the current block, and the current transaction. The EVM is designed to be  deterministic  on a wide variety of  hardware  and  operating systems , so that given a pre-transaction state and a transaction, each node produces the same post-transaction state, thereby enabling network consensus. The formal definition of the EVM is specified in the Ethereum Yellow Paper. [ 25 ] [ 70 ]  EVMs have been implemented in  C++ ,  C# ,  Go ,  Haskell ,  Java ,  JavaScript ,  Python ,  Ruby ,  Rust ,  Elixir ,  Erlang , and soon [ when? ]   WebAssembly . [ citation needed ]", "Gas is a  unit of account  within the EVM used in the calculation of the transaction fee, which is the amount of ETH a transaction's sender must pay to the network to have the transaction included in the blockchain. Each type of operation which may be performed by the EVM is  hardcoded  with a certain gas cost, which is intended to be roughly  proportional  to the monetary value of the resources (e.g.  computation  and  storage ) a node must expend or dedicate to perform that operation. [ citation needed ]", "When a sender is creating a transaction, the sender must specify a  gas limit  and  gas price . The  gas limit  is the maximum amount of gas the sender is willing to use in the transaction, and the  gas price  is the amount of ETH the sender wishes to pay to the network per unit of gas used. A transaction may only be included in the blockchain at a block slot that has a  base gas price  less than or equal to the transaction's  gas price . The portion of the  gas price  that is in excess of the  base gas price  is known as the tip and goes to the block proposer; the higher the tip, the more incentive a block proposer has to include the transaction in their block, and thus the quicker the transaction will be included in the blockchain. The sender buys the full amount of gas (i.e. their ETH balance is debited  gas limit  ×  gas price  and their gas balance is set to  gas limit ) up-front, at the start of the execution of the transaction, and is refunded at the end for any unused gas. If at any point the transaction does not have enough gas to perform the next operation, the transaction is reverted but the sender is still only refunded for the unused gas. In  user interfaces , gas prices are typically denominated in gigawei (Gwei), a subunit of ETH equal to 10 −9  ETH. [ 71 ]", "The EVM's  instruction set  is  Turing-complete . [ 25 ]  Popular uses of Ethereum have included the creation of fungible (ERC-20) and non-fungible (ERC-721) tokens with a variety of properties,  crowdfunding  (e.g.  initial coin offerings ),  decentralized finance ,  decentralized exchanges ,  decentralized autonomous organizations  (DAOs), games,  prediction markets , and gambling.

They can be written in  Solidity  (a language library with similarities to  C  and  JavaScript ), as well as others.  Source code and compiler information are usually published on blockchain explorer websites soon after the launch of the contract so that users can see the code and verify that it compiles to the bytecode that is on-chain.

The standard provides functions that include the transfer of tokens from one account to another, getting the current token balance of an account, and getting the total supply of the token available on the network. Smart contracts that correctly implement ERC-20 processes are called ERC-20 Token Contracts, and they keep track of created tokens on Ethereum. Numerous cryptocurrencies have launched as ERC-20 tokens and have been distributed through  initial coin offerings .

[ 75 ]  ERC-721 is the first official NFT standard for Ethereum and was followed up by ERC-1155 which introduced semi-fungibility; both are widely used, [ 76 ]  though some fully fungible tokens using ERC-20 have been used for NFTs such as  CryptoPunks .
